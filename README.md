# organoid_growth
A repository of the code used in the paper "An agent-based modelling framework to study growth mechanisms in EGFR-L858R mutant alveolar type II cells"

The neighbour-dependent model can be run from the file organoid_sim_code_jan_24.py. The depletion model (involving long-range interactions) can be run from organoid_sim_code_jan_24_with_depletion.py. Measurement of the curvature of the experimental organoids occurs within image_concave_hull_mesure_images; the images themselves can be found in the organoid_images folder. Figures are produced from organoid_vis_code.ipynb.
